# Simple-HTML-Gulp

### This will create a simple site which can be run on your localhost using Gulp.

- To use, first navigate into the directory where you want the project to be and run `git clone git@github.com:jevkid/Simple-HTML-Gulp.git`

- `cd` into that folder

- Make sure you have Node installed so you can run `npm` for more information go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

- Now ensure you have `gulp` installed- you can do this using `npm install --global gulp-cli` for more information go to https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md

- This repo should already have the dependencies you need, but feel free to add more. Install these now by running `npm install`. Depending on your settings you may have to run this as the root user.

- This should create a folder called `node_modules` where all of your dependencies will live. Once this is complete, you can run `gulp watch` to start your webserver.

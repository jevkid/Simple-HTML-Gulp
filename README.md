# Simple-HTML-Gulp

### This will create a simple site which can be run on your localhost using Gulp.

- Make sure you have Node installed first. For more information go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
- To use, first navigate into the directory where you want the project to be and run `git clone git@github.com:jevkid/Simple-HTML-Gulp.git`

- `cd` into that folder

- Now ensure you have `gulp` installed- you can do this using `npm install --global gulp-cli` for more information go to https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md

- run `npm install`

- Depending on your settings you may have to run this as the root user. This repo should already have the dependencies you need, but feel free to add more. 

- This should create a folder called `node_modules` where all of your dependencies will live. Once this is complete, you can run `gulp watch` to start your webserver.

- You should now be able to access your page at http://localhost:8080/

- The `index.html` has Bootstrap CSS and jQuery already linked- you can add to these or remove them as you like.
